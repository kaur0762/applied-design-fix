# Assignment 2: Applied Design Fix

For this assignment you must improve the design of the Adventure Co. website by applying the design principles (CRAP, Gestalt, Colour Theory, Typographic Hierarchy, etc.) discussed in week 4.

The improvements should be made with CSS only and you may include or remove as much of the existing CSS as you want (you can even delete all of the CSS and start entirely from scratch if you like). You may change colours, fonts, etc. However, do not edit the HTML. This is a CSS only exercise.

When you assignment is completed, the website should...

- Have consistent sizing and spacing of elements
- Have a clear, consistent type hierarchy
- Be responsive (layout will be tested at 360px and 1440px wide)
- Have a strong colour scheme with sufficient colour contrast
